// what is an application development waterfall model ?
/*
 * The Waterfall model is a type of software development methodology that is
 * linear and sequential, often used in project management. It's called
 * "Waterfall" because the model develops systematically from one phase to
 * another in a downward fashion, like a waterfall.
 * 
 * The phases in the Waterfall model are:
 * 
 * Requirements: All possible requirements of the system to be developed are
 * captured in this phase.
 * Design: The system design is prepared from the requirement specifications
 * which were studied in the first phase.
 * Implementation: With inputs from the system design, the system is first
 * developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next
 * phase.
 * Integration and Testing: All the units developed in the implementation phase
 * are integrated into a system after testing of each unit.
 * Deployment: After successful testing, the product is delivered/deployed to
 * the customer.
 * Maintenance: There is an ongoing maintenance to fix the bugs which were not
 * discovered during the earlier stages.
 * One of the major drawbacks of this model is that it does not allow much
 * reflection or revision once an application is in the testing stage.
 */

// what is an application development prototype model ?
/*
 * The Prototype model is a software development process in which a prototype is
 * built, tested, and then reworked as necessary until an acceptable outcome is
 * achieved. This model works best in scenarios where not all of the project
 * requirements are known in detail ahead of time. It is an iterative,
 * trial-and-error process that takes place between the developers and the
 * users.
 * 
 * Key characteristics of the Prototype model include:
 * 
 * Learning from failures: Early and frequent feedback from users can help
 * identify issues and misunderstandings about the system requirements.
 * User involvement: Users are actively involved in the development, which
 * increases their acceptance of the final system.
 * Iterative refinement: Based on the feedback, the prototype is refined and
 * iterated until it meets the users' expectations.
 * This model is particularly useful when the requirements are not clear at the
 * beginning of the project, or when new, innovative, or risky functionality is
 * being developed.
 * 
 */

// what is an application development agile model ?
/*
 * The Agile model is a type of software development methodology that emphasizes
 * flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It involves iterative
 * development, where requirements and solutions evolve through the
 * collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams.
 * 
 * Key characteristics of Agile model include:
 * 
 * Incremental: Small, usable portions of the software are delivered
 * periodically.
 * Iterative: Each iteration is a complete software project including all the
 * tasks necessary to release the mini increment of new functionality: planning,
 * requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and documentation.
 * Evolving: As the product is tested and used, feedback is used to refine and
 * reprioritize the overall product backlog.
 * Collaborative: Customers, developers, and testers continuously interact with
 * each other.
 * Agile methods include scrum, lean, kanban and extreme programming (XP).
 */

// what is an application development kanban model ?
/*
 * The Kanban model is a methodology for managing software development in a
 * highly efficient way. It is based on the principles of just-in-time
 * production and inventory control.
 * 
 * Key characteristics of the Kanban model include:
 * 
 * Visualization: The Kanban board is used to visualize the workflow. Each
 * column on the board represents a stage in the workflow.
 * Limiting Work in Progress (WIP): By limiting how much unfinished work is in
 * process, the team can focus on completing tasks.
 * Flow Management: The team monitors the systemâ€™s efficiency and makes
 * adjustments to improve flow.
 * Explicit Policies: The team makes policies explicit and displays them where
 * all can see.
 * Feedback Loops: The team holds regular meetings to discuss problems and find
 * solutions.
 * The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and
 * fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or
 * throughput.
